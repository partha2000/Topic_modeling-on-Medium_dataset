# Topic modeling on Medium articles dataset
Testing various unsupervised topic modeing algorithms on the Medium articles dataset.
## Description: 
Topic modeling refers to the task of discovering the underlying thematic structure in a text corpus, where the output is commonly presented as a report of the top terms appearing in each topic. Despite the diversity of topic modeling algorithms that have been proposed, a common challenge in successfully applying these techniques is the selection of an appropriate number of topics for a given corpus.

### To be tested:
- [ ] : LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- [ ] : NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)
- [ ] : LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)

### How to reproduce: 
The code sample present in this repository will not work on your machine with simple clonning. You will need to install all the dependencies present in the `requirements.txt` file. Further you need download the dataset from the above link and change the working directory inside the notebook to the one of your choice.
